# TriangleRepo

I was building this game as a way of learning SOLID principles with my friend Ione who wanted to learn about C#. We stopped as Unity was a lot to learn when your focus is just C# and C# relevant to work and because C# handles alot of the hierachical architecture it was not ideal for SOLID. 

It is a game I would make in the distant future with the right friends.

This is a playlist about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfojXKNCJi8&list=PLA7NIPQptVFc1UD-8WRcGBnu0Sb2V4w5U

Ione and myself used professional methodologies while working on the site with user stories, spikes, sprints and using trello. 


This is my main portfolio website. It is accessible at https://phy5prt.github.io/BootstrapPortfolioWebsite/

This Website features: Simple animations for a little movement and colour. It is mobile friendly and easy to use. It has a contact page with a contact form using dataFire SaaS as a backend service utilising gmail api. It is just a clean, simple and professional site.

My creative site is accessible at https://lit-escarpment-48431.herokuapp.com/ it has the same information though is more creatively displayed with backend database, filtering and animations. This site is not currently suitable for smaller devices.
